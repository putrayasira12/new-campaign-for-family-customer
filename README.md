- **Specific**: Increase family customer purchases by conducting a comprehensive analysis of previous campaign results.
- **Measurable**: Achieve a 10% increase in family customer purchases.
- **Achievable**: Based on the results of previous campaigns, it is feasible to achieve a 10% increase in family customer purchases.
- **Relevant**: Analyzing the results of previous campaigns can help formulate new strategies to increase purchases among family customers.
- **Time Bound**: Achieve a 10% increase in family customer purchases in the next month.

### Problem Statement ðŸŽ¯
Increase family customer purchases by 10% in the next month through analyzing data from previous marketing campaigns.

### Defining the Problem ðŸ“Š

To achieve our objective, we need to address several key questions through data analysis:

1. **Customer Demographics**: What is the profile of family customers in terms of marital status and salary range?
2. **Product Preferences**: What are the most and least popular products purchased by family customers?
3. **Purchase Behavior**: How frequently do family customers make purchases, and through which channels?
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Is there any correlation between total purchases and factors such as the number of children and available discounts?
5. **Campaign Responses**: How effective were previous campaigns in terms of family customer engagement?
6. **Customer Feedback**: What are the common complaints from family customers, and how can they be addressed?

By addressing these questions, we can uncover actionable insights that will inform our campaign strategies.

### Data Source ðŸ“Š

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about customer demographics, purchase behaviors, and previous campaign outcomes.

### Visualization and Analysis Tool ðŸ“ˆ

To effectively analyze and visualize the data, we use Jupyter Notebook for processing and statistical analysis, along with Tableau for data visualization. Tableau allows for interactive, insightful analysis, making the results understandable to non-technical stakeholders.

### Results ðŸš€

From the analysis, we obtained several insights:

1. **Customer Profile**:
   - Married customers are the most common, making up 39% of the store's customer base.
   - The annual salary range of married customers is around $158,356.

2. **Product Preferences**:
   - Most popular products: wine, meat, gold, and fish.
   - Least popular products: sweets and fruit.

3. **Purchase Behavior**:
   - 38% of purchases made by family customers occurred in the last month.
   - 59% of purchases by family customers were made directly in the store.

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Negative correlation between total purchases and number of children.
   - No correlation between total purchases and available discounts.

5. **Campaign Effectiveness**:
   - 98 customers responded to previous campaigns.
   - The most successful campaigns were campaigns 4, 3, and 5.

6. **Customer Feedback**:
   - 38% of complaints were from family customers.

### Recommendations ðŸ“ˆ

Based on the insights, the following suggestions are made for the next campaign:

1. **Stock and Advertising**:
   - Increase the stock of popular products (wine, meat, gold) and create more family-appealing advertisements for these items.
   
2. **Discounts**:
   - Provide discounts for less popular products (fish, sweets, fruit) to increase their purchases and reduce inventory waste.

3. **Customer Survey**:
   - Conduct a survey among family customers to gather feedback for store improvements.

4. **Campaign Strategy**:
   - Model the new campaign on the successful elements of previous campaigns 3, 4, and 5.

By implementing these strategies, we aim to achieve a 10% increase in family customer purchases in the next month with the new campaign.
